# rmxMUD Prototypes
Concept sandbox for a graphical MUD/MU*-inspired chat system made with React / Remix

## ChatCanvas
![screenshot](imgs/ChatCanvasMain.png)
Chat system for MUD/text-based games centered around location. Click on points to open menus for hotspots, start a local chat, or interact with objects. Chat history for all messages sent and received are also visible in the tray on the left.

The general idea here is to take a thread of text or other UGC elements and give them a little more context.

Another theme for testing (and dark mode.)
